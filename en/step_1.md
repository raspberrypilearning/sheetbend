## Introduction

There are several thousand different knots, each of which serves a particular purpose in a unique way, however, there is only one great generalist knot: the sheet bend. This knot can perform almost any job you need of a knot, and it’s secure and easy to tie. In other words, if you only know one knot, it should be this one.

The most basic use of the sheet bend is joining two ropes together. Unlike the more famous reef knot (a knot which, while widely taught, doesn’t actually do any jobs well, other than securing the reefing lines on a sailing ship), the sheet bend doesn’t require both ropes to be the same. It can join thinner ropes to thicker ropes, although there is a limit on how different the ropes can be, the only real way of telling is to try to tie the knot and see if it slips or not.
